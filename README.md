Constitutive Drivers using Python

## getting started with Python

It is suggested to install Python through Anaconda as other methods of installation might lead to compatibility issues.

You can find the installation instructions here:
```
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
```

Next, we need to create an environment to be used in this course. To do this, open your command line/terminal (in Windows: open the 'Anaconda Prompt') and change the directory to the folder containing the code.  An example of the command would be:
```
cd ~/Documents/CIVL575_constitutive_driver
```
The relevant supplemnetary packages required for the code are listed in the file 'environment.yml'.  To install them, enter the following command:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## running the notebook 

Before running the notebook, we have to activate the environment by entering the following command:
```
conda activate env_civl575
```
To launch jupyter lab:
```
jupyter lab
```
This will open a jupyter lab instance in your web browser.  Using the directory on the left hand side, you can navigate and click on a .ipynb file to open it.
